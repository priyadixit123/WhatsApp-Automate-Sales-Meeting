 n8n AI Meeting Assistant workflow  

Let me explain clearly what this workflow is doing and where you might face issues + improvements you can make.



# 🚀 What This Workflow Does (Simple Explanation)

This workflow builds an **AI Pre-Meeting Assistant** that:

1. ⏰ Runs every hour
2. 📅 Checks Google Calendar for meetings happening in the next 1 hour
3. 👥 Extracts attendee details
4. 📧 Fetches last Gmail correspondence with each attendee
5. 🔎 Scrapes their LinkedIn (via Apify)
6. 🤖 Uses OpenAI to:

   * Summarize emails
   * Summarize LinkedIn profile + activity
   * Generate a smart pre-meeting WhatsApp message
7. 📲 Sends you a WhatsApp reminder

# 🧠 Workflow Flow Breakdown (Step-by-Step)

### 1️⃣ Schedule Trigger

Runs every hour.

⬇

### 2️⃣ Check For Upcoming Meetings

Uses Google Calendar:

* timeMin = now
* timeMax = now + 1 hour

If meeting found → continue

⬇

### 3️⃣ Extract Attendee Info

Uses LLM to extract:

* name
* email
* linkedin_url

⬇

### 4️⃣ For Each Attendee

Split → Research each person separately:

### 📧 Email Branch

* Check if email exists
* Fetch last Gmail message
* Summarize with OpenAI

### 🔗 LinkedIn Branch

* If LinkedIn URL exists
* Scrape via Apify using cookie
* Extract:

  * About
  * Activity
* Summarize using OpenAI

⬇

### 5️⃣ Merge Everything

Combine:

* Meeting info
* Email summary
* LinkedIn summary

⬇

### 6️⃣ Generate Final SMS Style Message

Using "Attendee Research Agent"

⬇

### 7️⃣ Send WhatsApp Message

# ⚠️ Important Issues You Must Fix

## 🚨 1. LinkedIn Cookie Placeholder

You still have:

```json
"<COPY_YOUR_LINKEDIN_COOKIES_HERE>"
```

This will FAIL until you paste:

* Your `li_at` cookie
* Full cookie string

⚠️ Also be careful:
LinkedIn can block your account if scraping aggressively.

---

## 🚨 2. LinkedIn Scraping Is Risky

This part:

```js
"value": "{{ $json.linkedin_cookies.match(/li_at=([^;]+)/)[1] }}"
```

If cookie format changes → workflow crashes.

Better approach:

* Store `li_at` only
* Avoid regex extraction
* Save it as clean variable

---

## 🚨 3. WhatsApp Number Is Hardcoded

```json
"recipientPhoneNumber": "44123456789"
```

You should:

* Make this dynamic
* Or store your real number

---

## 🚨 4. Using Same Workflow as Subworkflow

You are using:

```json
"workflowId": "={{ $workflow.id }}"
```

This means:
It calls itself as subworkflow.

⚠️ That can cause recursion issues.

Better:

* Duplicate workflow
* Make a separate "Attendee Research Subworkflow"

---

# 💡 How To Make This Production-Ready

### ✅ 1. Add Error Logging

Add:

* Error trigger
* Slack/Email alert if scraping fails

---

### ✅ 2. Add Memory (CRM Integration)

Instead of scraping LinkedIn every time:

Store:

* Attendee data in Notion / Airtable
* Only refresh monthly

Will reduce:

* API cost
* Scraping risk

---

### ✅ 3. Upgrade LLM Model

Instead of:

```
gpt-4o-2024-08-06
```

Use:

```
gpt-4.1-mini
```

Cheaper + faster for summarization.

---

# 💰 Estimated Monthly Cost

If:

* 3 meetings per day
* 2 attendees each

You’ll use roughly:

* OpenAI: $5–10
* Apify: $5 free tier
* WhatsApp Cloud: Free under limit
